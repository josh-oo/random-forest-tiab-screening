I1,"Does the paper describe a randomized controlled trial (RCT), controlled clinical trial (CCT), or any trial with prospective assignment of participants?",study_design,include,"This inclusion criterion is like the ""I3""; however, ""I3"" was to look for words linked to RCT, while this one is more conceptual. In addition, here we also ask for ""trial with prospective assignment of participants,"" because the selection AI missed studies where interventions were mentioned but not the study design. The latter part of this question asks for that. On the other hand, given the fact that this generates noise because it also selects studies with interventions but without randomization (which are not of interest), we could consider optimizing it and splitting it accordingly."
I2,"Does the paper include or reference a trial registry identifier (e.g., NCT, ISRCTN, EudraCT, or similar)?",study_design,include,"This is a repetition of ""I1""; we can optimize"
I3,"Is this an interventional study where participants receive a defined treatment, program, or intervention (as opposed to purely observational or qualitative research)?",study_design,include,"This tends to narrow the scope of the ""trial with prospective assignment of participants"" of ""I4""; we can consider an optimization."
I4,Does the study include participants with schizophrenia or schizophrenia spectrum disorders?,population,include,"This is like ""I4"", in the sense that this is used for conceptual querying to the model while the ""I2"" looks for terms. This is a bit broader and it is like a safety net for the other. We could plan an optimization."
I5,"Does the study include participants with non-affective psychotic disorders, such as first-episode psychosis, brief psychotic disorder, or delusional disorder?",population,include,"OK, this goes into detail on the diagnoses/symptoms typically in schizophrenia patients we need anyway."
I6,Does the study include participants with schizoaffective disorder?,population,include,"OK, this goes into detail on the diagnoses/symptoms typically in schizophrenia patients we need anyway."
I7,Does the study include participants with schizophreniform disorder?,population,include,"OK, this goes into detail on the diagnoses/symptoms typically in schizophrenia patients we need anyway."
I8,Does the study include participants with schizotypy or schizotypal disorder?,population,include,"OK, this goes into detail on the diagnoses/symptoms typically in schizophrenia patients we need anyway."
I9,Does the study include participants experiencing persistent hallucinations?,population,include,"OK, this goes into detail on the diagnoses/symptoms typically in schizophrenia patients we need anyway."
I10,"Does the study include participants at clinical or ultra-high risk for psychosis (e.g., prodromal psychosis, at-risk mental state)?",population,include,"OK, this goes into detail on the diagnoses/symptoms typically in schizophrenia patients we need anyway."
I11,Is the study focused on participants with akathisia (as the primary condition or target population)?,population,include,"OK, this goes into detail on the diagnoses/symptoms typically in schizophrenia patients we need anyway."
I12,Is the study focused on participants with tardive dyskinesia?,population,include,"OK, this goes into detail on the diagnoses/symptoms typically in schizophrenia patients we need anyway."
I13,Does the study include participants diagnosed with serious mental illness (SMI) that includes psychotic disorders?,population,include,"OK, this was created to broadly include patients because schizophrenia is a SMI, and we need this for those studies not directly mentioning schizophrenia that might contain schizophrenic patients."
I14,Does the study include participants with dual diagnosis (a psychotic disorder plus a substance use disorder)?,population,include,"OK, this is a detailed question because of the attention flows of models. It happened that, for example, the study mentioned schizophrenic patients with cannabis use, and focusing on cannabis use it considered not ""purely"" on schizophrenia and excluded them."
I15,Does the study include relatives or caregivers of individuals with schizophrenia-spectrum disorders?,population,include,"OK, this is to capture studies on caregivers of schizophrenic patients, but not for other patients (depression, bipolar)."
I16,"Does the study focus on stigma, education, or awareness about schizophrenia or serious mental illness, even if the participants are from the general population?",population,include,"This is really painful because it is used to capture those studies that focus on the stigmatization toward patients with schizophrenia. Actually, this is like an independent search within the search, and it is really problematic for AI. However, we have these studies in the database, so we should consider if we want to include this question within the call for schizophrenia-related questions or separate it."
I17,"Does the study involve brain stimulation techniques (e.g., ECT, rTMS, tDCS, VNS, MST) targeting schizophrenia-spectrum populations?",special_interventions,include,"This was added because it is often the case that the interventions mentioned in the question are named without the name of the condition, like schizophrenia. However, given that these interventions are commonly provided to patients with schizophrenia, it is essential to retain this because it helps the system not to discard studies that may be included anyway. This is similar to what happens above regarding the retention of studies having the prospective interventions, because in that case, we should try not to miss interventional studies and then limit it to randomized studies. In this case, it is about a specific intervention, so the design here is interventional."
E1,Is this an animal study conducted exclusively on animals (no human participants)?,study_design,exclude,OK
E2,"Is this a systematic review, meta-analysis, scoping review, narrative review, or literature review?",study_design,exclude,OK
E3,"Is this a case report or case series (explicitly identified as such, or describing single-case design)?",study_design,exclude,OK
E4,Is this a retraction notice without substantive study content?,study_design,exclude,"I found this problematic because AI excludes content even when, for example, something interesting is mentioned in the abstract, simply because it identifies a retraction and immediately excludes the document. This probably needs some tweaks."
E5,Is this a single-arm or single-group observational study with no control group?,study_design,exclude,OK
E6,"Is this a purely observational, registry, or retrospective study without intervention assignment?",study_design,exclude,OK
E7,"Is this a purely qualitative study (based on interviews, focus groups, or narratives) without any assigned intervention?",study_design,exclude,OK
E8,"Is this a study conducted exclusively on healthy volunteers, such as physiological or Phase I studies?",population,exclude,OK
E9,"Does the study focus exclusively on affective psychosis, such as bipolar disorder, psychotic depression, or postpartum psychosis, without including non-affective psychotic disorders?",population,exclude,OK
E10,"Does the study involve brain stimulation targeting only mood disorders, and not psychotic disorders?",population,exclude,"Ths compleetes the issue of ""I20"""
E11,"Does the study include relatives or caregivers supporting non-psychotic conditions, such as dementia, depression, or autism?",population,exclude,OK
E12,Is the document a purely administrative retraction notice without any substantive study details?,study_quality,exclude,"This duplicates ""E4""; we could plan a merger/optimization."
